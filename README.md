PowerNode
=========

A Node.js module to interface with PowerSchool

Why?

Firstly, why not? The main reason behind this project was an easy to use API to get raw data from PowerSchool, for graphs and alternative front ends for PowerSchool (**cough** *centerscout* **cough**).

Usage
=====

```javascript
var powernode = require('powernode');
```
